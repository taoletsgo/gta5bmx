<h1>Some temporary bugs</h1>
<h2>⚠️Respawn location is on the ground（in some races）</h2>
<p>BUG description: When the checkpoint is on a red/green container, BMX will be respawn on the ground.</p>
<p>Solution: Tell me the exact map name and I will manually modify the value of that race.</p>
<h2>⚠️No ragdoll ？</h2>
<p>The ragdoll system cannot be turned on temporarily, otherwise it will be very easy to fall.</p>
